                        Millions of Americans rely on Social Security for income
                        during retirement. To ensure finanical well-being, most
                        American adults also invest in retirement assets such as
                        401(k) plans, pensions, or IRAs.

                        However, no matter the type of retirement investment,
                        starting early is imperative to take advantage of immense
                        wealth generated by time and compound interest.
